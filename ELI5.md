# Chainlink: Explain Like I'm 5

## What is it?

Chainlink is a **to-do list for AI assistants**.

When you use AI tools like Claude to help you code, the AI sometimes forgets what it was doing - especially during long conversations or when you start a new chat.

Chainlink solves this by giving the AI a place to write down:
- What it's working on
- What's done
- What's next
- Important notes for later

## How does it work?

1. **You ask the AI to do something** → The AI creates a task in Chainlink
2. **The AI works on it** → It updates the task with progress and notes
3. **Conversation ends or resets** → No problem! The tasks are saved
4. **New conversation starts** → The AI reads the tasks and picks up where it left off

## Why should I care?

- **No more repeating yourself** - The AI remembers what you were working on
- **Better handoffs** - Switch between AI sessions without losing context
- **Automatic changelog** - When tasks are done, they're logged automatically

## One-liner

> Chainlink gives AI assistants a memory that survives between conversations.
